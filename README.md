# Week-2
Repository for the week 2 assignment

## Description
This is the repository containing solutions to each of the four sub-tasks for the first week's
data management assignment. Each task is located in its own directory as a Jupyter Notebook,
as well as a regular python script.

- Data: Contains data used by all the sub-tasks
- Delopgave-1: Contains code related to the name list sub-task
- Delopgave-2: Contains code related to the loganalysis sub-task
- Delopgave-3: Contains code related to the error handling sub-task
- Delopgave-4: Contains code related to the pandas sub-task

## Dependencies
Required python packages can be found in *requirements.txt*
The main used packages are matplotlib, wordcloud, and pandas.

## Running the program
In order to run each program, navigate to one of the "delopgave" directories. The either run the corresponding notebook 
or the identical python script with for example:

`python navneliste.py`

## Reflections on difficulties
For the most part it was a relatively straight forward assignment. However, there were still a few things I struggled with:

- Clarification on what task 3 was asking for. I found it a bit difficult to interpret what the task was asking for in terms of requirements.
